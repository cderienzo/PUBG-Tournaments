# PUBG-Tournaments

A simple Unity project that lists PUBG tournaments. 

It interacts with PUBG's official Developer API, making a request to the `/tournaments` endpoint and rendering the obtained results in a GUI.  

A search input field was also added to filter the tournaments list by *tournament ID*. 

## Usage

Open project with Unity and either run in-site or select Build and Run for creating a .exe file.


## Plugins

The [SimpleJSON](https://github.com/Bunny83/SimpleJSON) plugin was added for facilitating the deserialization of JSON data.
